##### Description of the given problem  
We will project and implement PowerEnjoy, a digital management system for a car-sharing service in the city of Milan, that exclusively employs electric cars and allow clients to use them.  
Clients will interact with the system by a dedicated web service.  
The system will include all the basic functions of a car-sharing service plus some extra features.  
The service will allows registered client to search and reserve a car using GPS position or a specific address.  
The main purposes of the new system are:
- Be more efficient and reliable than the previous system.
